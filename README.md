# Homebridge Leviton Home/Away Plugin

</span>

Homebridge plugin that provides a switch corresponding to the My Leviton "Home/Away" residence status. The switch corresponds to the
following values:

- On: Set My Leviton residence status to "Home"
- Off: Set residence status to "Away"

This can then be used in various automations within HomeKit. For example, a presence automation can toggle the switch on/off, which
in turn would trigger My Leviton scenes (and, for Away mode, native lights randomization).
